# NeXT Coding Style Guide

This document outlines the coding conventions and style guidelines to be followed in the NeXT rewrite. Consistent coding style ensures readability, maintainability, and reduces errors in the codebase.

---

## 1. General Principles

- **Readability First:** Code should be written to be easily understood by other developers. Prioritize clarity over brevity.
- **Consistency:** Follow the established patterns in this document. When in doubt, match the style of existing code.
- **Comments:** Use comments to explain complex logic, assumptions, or non-obvious behavior. Comments should be concise but informative.

---

## 2. Variable Naming

- **Global Variables:** All global variables must be prefixed with `nxt` to avoid conflicts with other plugins or user variables (e.g., `nxtDeltaMachine`).
- **Descriptive Names:** Use full, descriptive names instead of abbreviations (e.g., `nxtCoolantFloodID` instead of `nxtCFID`).
- **Case:** Use camelCase for variable names (e.g., `nxtProbeResults`).

---

## 3. Expression Handling in Conditionals

- **Wrapping Required:** All expressions in the conditional part of `if` statements must be wrapped in curly braces `{}` to ensure proper parsing of complex expressions.
- **Examples:**
  - Correct: `if { exists(param.S) && param.S > 0 }`
  - Incorrect: `if exists(param.S) && param.S > 0`
- **Reason:** This prevents parsing ambiguities, especially with logical operators like `&&` and `||`.

## 4. G-code and M-code Conventions

- **Industry Standards:** Adhere to NIST standards for G-code numbering where possible.
- **Extensions:** For functionality not implemented by RepRapFirmware (RRF), use standard G-codes (e.g., `G37` for tool measurement).
- **Wrapper Macros:** To add safety or features to existing RRF commands (e.g., `M3`, `M5`), create "wrapper" macros with a decimal extension (e.g., `M3.9`, `M5.9`). These wrappers contain custom logic and then call the base RRF command.
- **NO Named Macros:** **DO NOT** create named macro files (e.g., `measure-tool-length.g`, `probe-workpiece.g`) that require M98 calls to execute. These are unwieldy, ugly, and inconsistent with CNC conventions. Instead, always create proper G-code or M-code macros that can be called directly.
- **Post-Processor Configuration:** Ensure post-processors are configured to output these extended codes.

---

## 5. Macro Structure

- **File Naming:** Core system files should use the `nxt` prefix where appropriate (e.g., `nxt.g`, `nxt-vars.g`).
- **G-code/M-code Naming:** All user-callable macros must be named as G-codes or M-codes (e.g., `G37.g`, `M3000.g`, `M6515.g`) to be executed directly without M98 calls.
- **Descriptive Named Files:** Only use descriptive names (e.g., `probe-workpiece.g`) for internal system files that are never called directly by users or post-processors. These should only be called from other macros using M98.
- **Error Handling:** Use `abort` for fatal errors with descriptive messages.
- **Validation:** Validate parameters early in macros to prevent runtime errors.

---

## 6. Comments and Documentation

- **Header Comments:** Each macro file should start with a comment describing its purpose, usage, and parameters.
- **Inline Comments:** Use inline comments for complex calculations or non-standard logic.
- **Variable Comments:** Comment global variable declarations with their purpose.

---

## 7. Best Practices

- **Avoid Magic Numbers:** Use named constants or variables instead of hard-coded numbers.
- **Modular Code:** Break down complex logic into smaller, reusable functions or macros.
- **Testing:** Write code with testing in mind; ensure macros can be tested independently.

## 8. Macro Naming Examples

### ‚úÖ CORRECT - G-code/M-code Macros
- `G37.g` - Tool length measurement (called as `G37`)
- `M3000.g` - Operator dialog prompt (called as `M3000`)  
- `M6515.g` - Coordinate limit checking (called as `M6515`)
- `G6500.g` - Bore probing cycle (called as `G6500`)

### ‚ùå INCORRECT - Named Macros Requiring M98
- `measure-tool-length.g` - Requires `M98 P"measure-tool-length.g"`
- `probe-workpiece.g` - Requires `M98 P"probe-workpiece.g"`
- `check-limits.g` - Requires `M98 P"check-limits.g"`

### üîß Internal System Files (Acceptable Named Files)
- `nxt-boot.g` - System initialization, called once from config
- `nxt-vars.g` - Variable definitions, called from system files
- `display-startup-messages.g` - Internal helper, called only by other macros

---

## 9. Parameter Naming

- **Avoid Axis Letters:** Do not use common axis letters (e.g., `X`, `Y`, `Z`, `A`, `B`, `C`, `U`, `V`, `W`) for parameters that do not represent a coordinate in that axis.
- **Avoid Reserved Letters:** Do not use letters that correspond to G-code or M-code commands (e.g., `G`, `M`, `T`). The `P` parameter is also frequently used by RRF for various purposes and should be used with caution.
- **Clarity:** Choose parameter letters that are descriptive or conventional for their purpose (e.g., `I` for ID, `F` for speed (feed), `R` for retries, `J` for axis index). Document the purpose of each parameter in the macro's header comment.
