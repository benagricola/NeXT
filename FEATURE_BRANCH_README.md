- Macro validates probe configuration and applies numerical compensations
- Stores compensated result in nxtLastProbeResult global variable

## Review Notes
This commit needs to be reviewed and adapted to work with the new NeXT directory structure before it can be merged back into main. The directory structure has changed since this commit was created:

- `macros/utilities/` â†’ may need to be moved to appropriate NeXT directories
- File conflicts with current structure need to be resolved
- Variable naming should follow NeXT conventions (nxt* prefix)

## Next Steps
1. Review the functionality provided by this commit
2. Adapt the code to work with the current NeXT structure
3. Resolve any conflicts with existing macros
4. Test the functionality
5. Create a proper PR to merge back into main
