# Named Public Macros
These are convenience macros that expose certain functionality to the operator.

By creating named macros in this particular format, DWC will show these as buttons that can be clicked by the operator.

There should be no significant code in these macro files. They should either directly call custom G- or M-codes, or simply toggle a variable to enable or disable settings and features.

Again - these are _convenience macros_ aimed at allowing novice operators a point-and-click experience in DWC.

These macros are moved into the `/macro` folder on release so they are automatically picked up by DWC.
